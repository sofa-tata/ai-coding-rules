# Pre-Commit Design Review

ADVISORY validation of code against design principles that linters cannot enforce.
Categorizes findings as Design Debt, Readability Debt, or Polish Opportunities.

## When to Use
- Automatically invoked by @linter-driven-development (Phase 4)
- Manually before committing (to validate design quality)
- After linter passes and tests pass

## What This Reviews
- **NOT code correctness** (tests verify that)
- **NOT syntax/style** (linter enforces that)
- **YES design principles** (primitive obsession, abstraction, architecture)
- **YES maintainability** (readability, storifying, self-validation)

## Review Scope

**Primary Scope**: Changed code in commit
- All modified lines
- All new files
- Specific focus on design principle adherence

**Secondary Scope**: Context around changes
- Entire files containing modifications
- Flag patterns/issues outside commit scope
- Suggest broader refactoring opportunities

## Finding Categories (Debt-Based)

### 🔴 Design Debt
**Will cause pain when extending/modifying code**

Violations:
- Primitive obsession (string IDs, int ports without types)
- Wrong architecture (horizontal layers vs vertical slices)
- Non-self-validating types (validation outside constructor)
- Missing error context (errors.New instead of fmt.Errorf)

Impact: Future changes will require more work and introduce bugs

### 🟡 Readability Debt
**Makes code harder to understand and work with**

Violations:
- Mixed abstraction levels (story + implementation details)
- Functions not storified (unclear flow)
- Defensive nil checks (should be in constructor)
- Generic naming (utils, common, data, manager)

Impact: Team members (and AI) will struggle to understand intent

### 🟢 Polish Opportunities
**Minor improvements for consistency**

Violations:
- Non-idiomatic naming
- Missing comments on complex logic
- Opportunities for minor refactoring

Impact: Low, but keeps codebase clean and consistent

## Review Workflow

### 1. Analyze Commit Scope
```bash
# Identify what changed
git diff --cached --name-only

# For each file, get changed lines
git diff --cached --unified=3 [file]
```

### 2. Check Against Design Principles
For each changed line/block, validate:
- [ ] Primitive obsession check (reference.md #1)
- [ ] Storifying check (reference.md #2)
- [ ] Self-validating types check (reference.md #3)
- [ ] Abstraction levels check (reference.md #4)
- [ ] Architecture check (reference.md #5)
- [ ] Naming check (reference.md #6)
- [ ] Testing approach check (reference.md #7)

### 3. Scan Broader Context
Review entire files containing changes:
- Are there similar violations outside commit scope?
- Would fixing require broader refactoring?
- Is there a pattern worth addressing holistically?

### 4. Categorize Findings
Assign each violation to debt category:
- Design Debt (🔴): Type safety, architecture, validation
- Readability Debt (🟡): Abstraction, naming, clarity
- Polish (🟢): Minor improvements

### 5. Generate Advisory Report
For each finding:
- **Location**: file:line
- **Issue**: Specific violation with current code
- **Better**: Suggested improvement with example
- **Why**: Impact explanation (connects to maintenance/understanding)
- **Fix**: Which skill to use (@code-designing, @refactoring, etc.)

## Output Format

See linter-driven-development workflow for integrated output.

Key elements:
- Commit scope summary
- Findings grouped by category (🔴 🟡 🟢)
- Specific line numbers and code examples
- Broader context observations
- Actionable next steps

## Advisory Nature

**This review does NOT block commits.**

Purpose:
- ✅ Provide visibility into design quality
- ✅ Offer concrete improvement suggestions
- ✅ Help maintain coding principles
- ✅ Guide refactoring decisions

User decides:
- Commit as-is (accept debt knowingly)
- Fix critical debt before commit
- Fix all debt before commit
- Expand scope to broader refactor

## Integration with Other Skills

When findings suggest deeper work:
- **Design Debt** → often needs @code-designing skill
- **Readability Debt** → often needs @refactoring skill
- **Architecture issues** → may need @code-designing + @refactoring

See reference.md for complete design principles checklist.
