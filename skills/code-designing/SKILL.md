# Code Designing

Domain type design and architectural planning for Go code.
Use when planning new features or identifying need for new types during refactoring.

## When to Use
- Planning a new feature (before writing code)
- Refactoring reveals need for new types (complexity extraction)
- Linter failures suggest types should be introduced
- When you need to think through domain modeling

## Purpose
Design clean, self-validating types that:
- Prevent primitive obsession
- Ensure type safety
- Make validation explicit
- Follow vertical slice architecture

## Workflow

### 1. Understand Domain
- What is the problem domain?
- What are the main concepts/entities?
- What are the invariants and rules?
- How does this fit into existing architecture?

### 2. Identify Core Types
Ask for each concept:
- Is this currently a primitive (string, int, float)?
- Does it have validation rules?
- Does it have behavior beyond simple data?
- Is it used across multiple places?

If yes to any → Consider creating a type

### 3. Design Self-Validating Types
For each type:
```go
// Type definition
type TypeName underlyingType

// Validating constructor
func NewTypeName(input underlyingType) (TypeName, error) {
    // Validate input
    if /* validation fails */ {
        return zero, errors.New("why it failed")
    }
    return TypeName(input), nil
}

// Methods on type (if behavior needed)
func (t TypeName) SomeMethod() result {
    // Type-specific logic
}
```

### 4. Plan Package Structure
- **Vertical slices**: Group by feature, not layer
- Each feature gets its own package
- Within package: separate by role (service, repository, handler)

Good structure:
```
user/
├── user.go          # Domain types
├── service.go       # Business logic
├── repository.go    # Persistence
└── handler.go       # HTTP/API
```

Bad structure:
```
domain/user.go
services/user_service.go
repository/user_repository.go
```

### 5. Design Orchestrating Types
For types that coordinate others:
- Make fields private
- Validate dependencies in constructor
- No nil checks in methods (constructor guarantees validity)

```go
type Service struct {
    repo        Repository  // private
    notifier    Notifier    // private
}

func NewService(repo Repository, notifier Notifier) (*Service, error) {
    if repo == nil {
        return nil, errors.New("repo required")
    }
    if notifier == nil {
        return nil, errors.New("notifier required")
    }
    return &Service{
        repo:     repo,
        notifier: notifier,
    }, nil
}

// Methods can trust fields are valid
func (s *Service) DoSomething() error {
    // No nil checks needed
    return s.repo.Save(...)
}
```

### 6. Review Against Principles
Check design against (see reference.md):
- [ ] No primitive obsession
- [ ] Types are self-validating
- [ ] Vertical slice architecture
- [ ] Types designed around intent, not just shape
- [ ] Clear separation of concerns

## Output Format

After design phase:

```
🎨 DESIGN PLAN

Feature: [Feature Name]

Core Domain Types:
✅ UserID (string) - Self-validating, prevents empty IDs
✅ Email (string) - Self-validating, RFC 5322 validation
✅ Age (int) - Self-validating, range 0-150

Orchestrating Types:
✅ UserService - Coordinates user operations
   Dependencies: Repository, Notifier
   Methods: CreateUser, GetUser, UpdateUser

Package Structure:
📁 user/
  ├── user.go          # UserID, Email, Age, User
  ├── service.go       # UserService
  ├── repository.go    # Repository interface + implementations
  ├── notifier.go      # Notifier interface + implementations
  └── handler.go       # HTTP handlers

Design Decisions:
- UserID is custom type to prevent passing empty/invalid IDs
- Email validation centralized in NewEmail constructor
- Vertical slice keeps all user logic in one package
- Repository as interface allows multiple backends (Postgres, in-memory for tests)

Integration Points:
- Consumed by: HTTP API (/users endpoints)
- Depends on: Database, Email service
- Events: UserCreated event published after creation

Next Steps:
1. Create types with validating constructors
2. Write unit tests for each type
3. Implement UserService
4. Write integration tests

Ready to implement? Use @testing skill for test structure.

## Key Principles

See reference.md for detailed principles:
- Primitive obsession prevention (Yoke design strategy)
- Self-validating types
- Vertical slice architecture
- Types around intent and behavior, not just shape
- Single responsibility per type

## Pre-Code Review Questions

Before writing code, ask:
- Can logic be moved into smaller custom types?
- Is this type designed around intent and behavior?
- Have I avoided primitive obsession?
- Is validation in the right place (constructor)?
- Does this follow vertical slice architecture?

Only after satisfactory answers, proceed to implementation.

See reference.md for complete design principles and examples.
